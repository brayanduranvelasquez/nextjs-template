This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Dependencies Installed

1. [SASS - CSS Pre-processor](https://sass-lang.com)
2. [Ant Design - UI Framework](https://ant.design/)
3. [Ant Design Icons](https://ant.design/components/icon)
4. [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/instance)
5. [Dayjs](https://day.js.org/)

## Customize Ant Design Theme

If we need to change the default UI of ant design, we can use their [theme editor](https://ant.design/theme-editor). After selecting and changing the UI such as colors, sizes and others, you can export a JSON where you can see the "token" object. That object has to be copy and paste in <i>/theme/index</i>. More info [here](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme).
